# dotenv

My dotenv project with package installations. Feel free to contribute.

## Usage
### Folder structure
| folder   |      Purpose      | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| list | place your lists for installation and login startup loadings in here |
| settings | settings scripts which are run at every login startup loadings |
| setups | place your one time setup scripts in here |

## Contributing
Please put your lists not in scripts but in a related list file under lists folder.

<BASE-DISTRO-NAME>-packages.list will be used for distro specific installation. Multi lines and multiple packages in a single line are supported.
